# Objectives
The general objective of this project is to design a methodology for identifying the disinformation potential of new or pre-existing sources on the web. The achievement of this objective will be possible by completing the following partial objectives:

- From sources of information of a known nature on "Politifacts.com" data, 
develop the necessary methodology to quantify the qualitative characteristics recorded
of the statements.
-  Determine the minimum set of representative characteristics for assessing similarities between statements using, and if necessary developing, dimensional reduction techniques.
- Simplify the initial similarity network by reducing complete networks to trees 
coating.
- Automate the analysis of communities in statement similarity networks considering 
the role of the resolution parameter in multi-resolution methods for determining 
communities.
