We are living in an era dominated by information, where politics, daily work, social media, and hobbies are all shaped by the constant bombardment of data and narratives. However, the reliability of information has become one of the greatest challenges of our time. The prevalence of disinformation and misinformation has undermined trust in online resources, making it increasingly difficult to discern truth from falsehood. Addressing this issue requires innovative tools and methodologies.

Complex networks provide a powerful framework for understanding the structural and relational dynamics of information ecosystems. By modeling how narratives propagate and interconnect, complex network allows us to uncover hidden patterns, identify influential sources, and detect clusters of related content. This paper proposes an approach to leverage these tools: using topic modeling to extract latent themes from the PolitiFact dataset, constructing a network based on cosine similarity, simplifying the network through a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and applying community detection to reveal insights into the structure and spread of disinformation.

This methodology offers a fresh perspective by integrating semantic and structural analysis to tackle the critical problem of unreliable information. It not only identifies prominent disinformation themes but also highlights their interrelations and propagation mechanisms, paving the way for more effective strategies to combat the spread of false narratives.
